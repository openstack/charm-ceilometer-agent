options:
  nagios_context:
    type: string
    default: "juju"

      Used by the nrpe-external-master subordinate charm.
      A string that will be prepended to instance name to set the host name
      in nagios. So for instance the hostname would be something like:
          juju-myservice-0
      If you're running multiple environments with the same services in them
      this allows you to differentiate between them.
  nagios_servicegroups:
    type: string
    default: ""
    description: |
        A comma-separated list of nagios servicegroups.
        If left empty, the nagios_context will be used as the servicegroup
  use-internal-endpoints:
    type: boolean
    default: False
    description: |
      Openstack mostly defaults to using public endpoints for
      internal communication between services. If set to True this option will
      configure services to use internal endpoints where possible.
