options:
  openstack-origin:
    type: string
    default: distro
    description: |
      Repository from which to install. May be one of the following:
      distro (default), ppa:somecustom/ppa, a deb url sources entry,
      or a supported Ubuntu Cloud Archive e.g.
      .
      cloud:<series>-<openstack-release>
      cloud:<series>-<openstack-release>/updates
      cloud:<series>-<openstack-release>/staging
      cloud:<series>-<openstack-release>/proposed
      .
      See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/OpenStack/CloudArchive for info on which
      cloud archives are available and supported.
      .
      NOTE: updating this setting to a source that is known to provide
      a later version of OpenStack will trigger a software upgrade unless
      action-managed-upgrade is set to True.
  action-managed-upgrade:
    type: boolean
    default: False
    description: |
      If True enables openstack upgrades for this charm via juju actions.
      You will still need to set openstack-origin to the new repository but
      instead of an upgrade running automatically across all units, it will
      wait for you to execute the openstack-upgrade action for this charm on
      each unit. If False it will revert to existing behavior of upgrading
      all units on config change.
  nagios_context:
    type: string
    default: "juju"
    description: |
      Used by the nrpe-external-master subordinate charm.
      A string that will be prepended to instance name to set the host name
      in nagios. So for instance the hostname would be something like:
          juju-myservice-0
      If you're running multiple environments with the same services in them
      this allows you to differentiate between them.
  nagios_servicegroups:
    type: string
    default: ""
    description: |
        A comma-separated list of nagios servicegroups.
        If left empty, the nagios_context will be used as the servicegroup
  use-internal-endpoints:
    type: boolean
    default: False
    description: |
      Openstack mostly defaults to using public endpoints for
      internal communication between services. If set to True this option will
      configure services to use internal endpoints where possible.
